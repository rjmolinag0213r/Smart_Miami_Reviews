# Data Source and Methodology

The data for this project is sourced directly from the Google Maps Places API, providing real-time, authentic user reviews for restaurants located in Miami.

## Data Characteristics

The dataset consists of qualitative, user-generated text reviews. This raw text is processed and analyzed to extract sentiment on key aspects of the dining experience.

## Important Note on Data Sampling

The analysis in this prototype is based on a curated data sample provided by the Google Maps API. The specific API endpoint used is designed to return the five "most relevant" reviews for a given location, rather than a complete, exhaustive list.

This is an intentional feature of the API to ensure a high-quality, representative snapshot of public opinion. Therefore, the results of this tool should be interpreted as a "first-look" analysis based on this sample, not as a comprehensive study of all available reviews.
